## WetLabApp

Using Kivy & KivyMD, this app is being designed with the intention of speeding up lab work by creating a set of simple calculation
tools that can be easily navigated and understood. My research in Materials Science require that I perform tedious approximations for solution concentration, film thickness, inter-particle spacing, etc. The purpose of this app is to speed experimental work with quick estimations. At the time of writing, the project is only partially finished.

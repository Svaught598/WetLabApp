This app was created while I was completing my M.S. in Physics at Texas A&M University in Commerce. 
I was conducting research in polymer physics that involved creating a lot of thin films from 
solutions with many different concentrations. Existing applications didn't help much due to small 
differences in the way that dilutions/solutions were calculated so I created this application 
to both help with my research and improve my programming skills.

Thanks for using the app!
